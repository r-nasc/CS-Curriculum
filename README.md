# <center>Self-Taught Computer Science</center>
After years practicing different aspects of IT as a hobbyist, I've commited to studying and building a proper/well-rounded curriculum by teaching myself CS inbetween work and my Bsc. in Mech.Eng.<br>
The repo is a place where I will log my learning process in an organized way, both for future reference and in the hopes that it can be useful to others.<br>
