After years practicing different aspects of IT as a hobbyist, I've committed to studying and building a proper/well-rounded curriculum by teaching myself CS in-between work and my BSc. in Mech. Eng.

The repo is a place where I will log my learning process in an organized way, both for future reference and in the hopes that it can be useful to others.

## Fundamentals
>Although nothing in this section was new to me, I decided some topics were worth revisiting. (Admittedly, was also a bit curious why these courses are so famous)

## Core
>This is where most of my knowledge gaps are, mainly due to lack of formal education. A solid understanding of the following areas is a MUST.
